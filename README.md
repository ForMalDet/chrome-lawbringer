proof-of-concept extension for google chrome that will monitor tab's CPU usage individually and terminate them if they exceed a threshhold. Also experimenting with pulling all JavaScript from webpages and collecting external links to javascript in an effort to detect malicious scripts and prevent them from running.


*only works on dev build currently*
